# Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy

In collaboration with Prof. Hadar Steinberg (HUJI), Dr. Sharon Beck (NRC Negev), and Dr. Iris Sabo-Napadensky (SNRC) we worl on various aspects anf applications of Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy. 

We operate 2 PAS systems:

- A Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) table-top system, design for defect measurements in bulk systyem.
- A Slow Positron Beam (SPOT) used for Doppler Broadedning Spectroscopy (DBS).

Additionally, led by Prof. Stienberg, we develop ultra-sensitive charge detectors, based on graphene devices, with the ultimate goal of detecting the charge signature of single positron annihilation events.
