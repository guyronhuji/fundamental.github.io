## Overview

The standard model of particle physics is currently the best description we have of the physical processes we observe in the universe. However, there are clear indications that the standard model is incomplete and that a new theoretical framework must replace it at some point.

Among the failings of the standard model are:

- The absence of a description of gravity compatible with the other forces.
- The standard model does not contain dark matter, which comprises ~20% of our universe, nor does it contain dark energy, which accounts for another 75%.
- The standard model contains many parameters, which must be determined from experiment.

## Our Approach

Several methods exist to search for physics beyond the standard model. High energy methods (direct searches) use large accelerators to directly search for these effects while low energy, ultra precise, experiments seek to discover the effects of the "beyond standard model" physics on the low energy observables.

**Our group focuses on the low energy method.**

## Methodology

The primary tool we use is the ElectroWeak interaction. In particular, we measure the nuclear **β decay** process of some radioactive isotopes, which can be exactly calculated in the standard model and thus allows us to search for any deviations from the calculation.

### Beta Decay Process

In the β decay process a neutron is converted to a proton by the emission of an electron and an anti-neutrino (β⁻ decay). The opposite process converts a proton to a neutron (β⁺ decay).

## Current Work

Currently we are in the process of designing and building a **Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT)** setup for studying the beta decay of radioactive Neon atoms.

We are also collaborating with groups at:

- [Soreq Nuclear Research Center](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/nuclear-research-center/govil-landing-page)
