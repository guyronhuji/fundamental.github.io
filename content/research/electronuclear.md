# ElectroNuclear Research

## Overview

This part of our research program focuses on using electronuclear (electron induced) or photonuclear (photon induced) reactions to study the strong nuclear force. We are interested in the strong force at low energies, where confinement prevents the use of perturbative techniques and calculations must rely on "effective field theories".

**Experiments are crucial to select between the different theories.**

## Main Focus

We are co-leading an experimental effort to precisely measure the **proton form factors** at very low energies. These form factors are parameters which describe the electromagnetic structure of the proton in the ground state.

The electric (G_E) and magnetic (G_M) form factors are related to the charge and magnetization distributions in the proton.

## Research Facility

This experiment, as well as most others we run, are conducted at the [Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab)](http://www.jlab.org), an electron accelerator located in Newport News, Virginia.

The JLab accelerator is quite unique in that it can provide a **high current beam of highly polarized electrons**.

### Hall A

Hall A is instrumented with two high precision detectors and can accommodate a wide range of additional detectors as well as various target systems.

## Recent Results

Recently, we concluded the first part of our experiment, in which we scattered polarized electrons off an unpolarized proton target, and then measured the polarization of the recoil proton.

This method allows an extremely clean extraction of the form factor ratio, with an **uncertainty of ~1%**, better than any other measurement ever done.
