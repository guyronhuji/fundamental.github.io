# Positron Systems & Instrumentation

Our group develops slow-positron beams and compact spectrometers to quantify vacancy-type defects and defect complexes in condensed matter. A moderated β⁺ source delivers tunable implantation energies, enabling depth profiling that we read out with two complementary techniques: **Doppler-broadening spectroscopy (DBS)** to access electron-momentum distributions via S/W line-shape parameters, and **positron-annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS)** to resolve trap lifetimes and size scales. Analysis treats detector response, timing, and stopping-power models as first-class components of inference, yielding depth-aware posteriors rather than point estimates and allowing consistency checks between DBS and PALS on identical specimens.

Methodologically, we emphasize calibration and cross-validation: reference materials for stability, shared priors linking energy-to-depth models across modalities, and explicit uncertainty propagation from counting statistics and instrument response through to materials parameters. Current work extends these pipelines to thicker and multilayer targets, where implantation profiles and source tails can bias fits if not modeled jointly.

In parallel, we explore **device-level charge sensing** as a complement to γ-based readout. Double-gated graphene FETs are biased at high transconductance and monitored under controlled exposure with coincidence tagging, to test whether local electrical signatures can register positron events near the channel. Together, these efforts provide a rigorous, depth-resolved view of defects across metals, semiconductors, and porous films, with a focus on reproducibility and interpretable comparisons to transport and structural measurements.
