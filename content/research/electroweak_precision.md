# ElectroWeak Precision Experiments at HUJI


## Why Precision at Low Energies?
The Standard Model (SM) has been spectacularly successful, yet it is incomplete: neutrino masses, the matter–antimatter asymmetry, and the ad‑hoc nature of many SM parameters all point to **physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM)**. While the energy frontier searches directly for new particles, **the precision (low‑energy) frontier** looks for tiny, theoretically clean deviations from SM predictions in electroweak processes. These measurements are sensitive to effective couplings that scale like $C_X^{(\ell)} \sim (v/\Lambda)^2$, so reaching sensitivities at the $10^{-3}$ level can probe new‑physics scales of $5\text{–}10\ \mathrm{TeV}$, complementary to collider constraints. Our program targets **beta decay and electron-capture observables**—spectra and correlation coefficients such as $a_{\beta\nu}$, the Fierz term $b_F$, and the neutrino asymmetry $B$—where theory is under excellent control and uncertainties can be quantified.

## Program Overview
We combine **dedicated experimental platforms** at the SARAF‑II accelerator (Israel) and partner facilities with a **state‑of‑the‑art theory effort** (ab‑initio nuclear structure, shell‑model, and EFT-based radiative and electromagnetic corrections). Together, these enable per‑mille–level comparisons between data and SM predictions across multiple nuclei and decay modes.

## Magneto‑Optical Trap + Velocity‑Map Imaging (MOT–VMI): $^{19,23}\mathrm{Ne}$
We operate one of the world’s most intense **neon MOTs** at SARAF, instrumented with a **velocity‑map imaging** (VMI) spectrometer in the science chamber. Metastable neon is produced by a helical resonator source, slowed in an optimized Zeeman slower and a 2D‑MOT, then transferred into the science MOT. In this trap, the **recoil ion, emitted beta, and shake‑off electrons** can be measured in coincidence. This configuration enables a **simultaneous extraction of the beta–neutrino correlation $a_{\beta\nu}$** and the **Fierz interference term $b_F$**, a unique capability when combined with precise knowledge of branching ratios.

- **Physics targets.**  
  - $^{19}\mathrm{Ne}$ is sensitive to CKM‑unitarity tests and features $a_{\beta\nu}$ near zero, enhancing sensitivity to BSM contributions for a fixed systematic floor.  
  - $^{23}\mathrm{Ne}$ undergoes pure Gamow–Teller decays (to ground and excited states), providing a clean probe for tensor interactions with robust theory control.

## Electrostatic Ion Beam Trap (EIBT): $^{6}\mathrm{He}$ (and beyond)
Our **electrostatic ion beam trap** stores a bunched beam of $^{6}\mathrm{He}^+$ that oscillates between electrostatic mirrors, creating a well‑defined, field‑free decay region. **Position‑sensitive scintillators** capture beta electrons while **annular MCP detectors** measure $^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ recoils with large geometrical acceptance. Full three‑body kinematics allow a precise determination of **$a_{\beta\nu}$** via basis‑function fits (pure axial vs. tensor hypotheses). Extensive **GEANT4 simulations** guide detector geometry, bunch parameters, and systematic controls. The EIBT approach is complementary to the neutral‑atom MOT.

## Unique First‑Forbidden Beta Spectra: $^{90}\mathrm{Sr}/^{90}\mathrm{Y}$ and $^{16}\mathrm{N}$
We pursue **high‑statistics beta‑spectrum measurements** with a cryogenic **Si(Li)** detector tailored for MeV‑scale electrons. For **unique first‑forbidden decays**, the spectral shape encodes not only the **Fierz term \(b\)** but also information on **$a_{\beta\nu}$**, enabling a **joint extraction** from a single spectrum when combined with realistic resolution, geometry, and dead‑layer modeling. An initial focus is the long‑lived **$^{90}\mathrm{Sr}/^{90}\mathrm{Y}$** system—enabling long runs without an accelerator—followed by **$^{16}\mathrm{N}$**. These data provide an **independent handle on $\mathbf{b_F}$** that is essential when interpreting correlation measurements from MOT/EIBT experiments, reducing degeneracies and tightening global fits.

## Electron‑Capture (EC) Neutrino Asymmetry with HUNTER: $^{131}\mathrm{Cs}$

Within the **HUNTER** apparatus (UCLA) we will measure the **neutrino asymmetry parameter $B_\nu$** in **polarized electron capture** of $^{131}\mathrm{Cs}$. A high‑acceptance **reaction‑ion momentum spectrometer** reconstructs the recoil $^{131}\mathrm{Xe}^{q+}$ ion and accompanying Auger electrons and x‑rays. Optical pumping in a duty‑cycled MOT achieves near‑maximal polarization; the **ion time‑of‑flight** encodes the recoil direction and thus the neutrino emission angle. Because $B_\nu$ (and the Fierz term $b_F$) enter **linearly** in certain combinations of couplings, EC asymmetry is exceptionally sensitive to **right‑handed currents and scalar/tensor interactions**, addressing a blind spot in current global beta‑decay analyses.

## Rare‑Isotope Production at SARAF‑II
The SARAF‑II CW 40‑MeV p/d accelerator provides **exceptional rare‑isotope fluxes** near stability. A heated production target feeds an evacuated transport line to the experimental area, where species are either **ionized and bunched** (for EIBT) or **excited to metastable states** (for MOT). Recent work has demonstrated **copious $^{23}\mathrm{Ne}$** production and precise branching‑ratio measurements; the **$^{6}\mathrm{He}$** line is commissioned with excellent performance. High yields reduce statistical uncertainties and enable **systematic‑control campaigns**.

## Theory: Ab‑initio, Shell‑Model, and EFT Corrections - Prof. Doron Gazit
The theory effort led by our collaborator Prof. Doron Gazit (HUJI), delivers the **per‑mille accuracy** required for BSM sensitivity:
- **Ab‑initio calculations** (e.g., symmetry‑adapted NCSM, coupled‑cluster) for $^{6}\mathrm{He}$, $^{16}\mathrm{N}$, and $^{23}\mathrm{Ne}$ compute matrix elements and higher‑order recoil effects with quantified uncertainties.
- **Shell‑model treatments** support heavier systems.
- **Systematic EM and radiative corrections** are implemented within an EFT framework (including finite‑size, Coulomb‑distortion, nuclear‑polarizability, and virtual‑pion effects), matched to the observables $a_{\beta\nu}$, $b)F$, and $B_\nu$.  
- A dedicated **order‑by‑order expansion for EC asymmetries** provides controlled predictions for the $^{131}\mathrm{Cs}$ program.

## Projected Sensitivity and Complementarity
Combining the MOT–VMI, EIBT, unique first‑forbidden spectra, and EC asymmetry data with our theory pipeline yields **multi‑channel constraints** on scalar and tensor couplings at the **percent to sub‑percent level**, closing unexplored windows in global fits and probing **effective scales of several TeV**. The same platforms and calculations also enable **sterile‑neutrino** and **right‑handed current** searches, making our program a versatile hub at the precision frontier.
