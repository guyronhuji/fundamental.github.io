# Other Research Projects

We engage in several additional research areas that complement our main investigations.

## Current Projects

## Unravelling Experimental Bias 

In collaboration with [Dr. Yael Assor](https://buberfellows.huji.ac.il/people/yael-assor) (socio-cultural anthropology), we are conducting a qualitative study of how experimental physicists define, prioritize, and mitigate bias across the life cycle of large-scale precision experiments. 

Through confidential, voluntary interviews with members of the MUSE collaboration at PSI, we map which stages (planning, execution, analysis) are most susceptible, how mitigation practices are implemented, how they shape results, and whether shared standards emerge within collaborations. 

This work aims to articulate practical, methodologically grounded templates for bias management that can be adopted across precision-measurement communities.
