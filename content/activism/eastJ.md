## Executive Summary

- The analysis compares **direct operation** vs. **franchise** models across HMOs (health funds) in Jerusalem, using FOI data for **2018–2022** (normalized to **per 10,000 enrollees**).  
- In **East Jerusalem**, there is a **higher share of franchised clinics** than in West Jerusalem, where branches are mostly directly operated.  
- Across multiple domains—**ER referrals**, **child development services**, and **screening in older adults**—the data show **systematic gaps** between the two operation models, with **worse access and continuity** in franchised clinics.  
- Policy recommendations emphasize **transition to direct operation**, **tailored quality metrics**, strengthened **monitoring**, and **workforce development** for East Jerusalem.

## Key Findings

### 1) Emergency‑Room (ER) Referrals
- **Franchise clinics** refer both **children** and **adults** to ER at **substantially higher rates** than **directly operated** clinics (multipliers on the order of **3–4×** across 2018–2022 averages).  
- Interpretation: Likely **deficits in urgent primary care capacity** within franchise sites, leading to **costly hospital spillovers** and greater operational burden on ERs.

### 2) Child Development Services (Ages 0–4)
**Speech‑Language Delay (diagnosis & treatment):**
- Direct operation shows **higher referral**, **higher diagnosis**, and **much higher treatment** completion rates (speech therapy) than franchise sites.  
- In a consolidated 2022 view: among children referred in **direct** clinics, ~**98%** were diagnosed and ~**97%** received treatment (mostly within HMO); in **franchise** clinics, ~**79%** were diagnosed and only ~**42%** received treatment (most within the HMO, some via contracted private providers).

**Motor Delay (physiotherapy / occupational therapy):**
- Across 2018–2022, **direct** clinics are **5–7×** more likely to **diagnose and treat** motor delays vs. **franchise** clinics, for both **physiotherapy** and **occupational therapy** pathways.

**Implication:** Marked **access and follow‑through gaps** in franchise clinics across the entire pathway (referral → diagnosis → therapy), despite national shortages and well‑known cultural barriers.

### 3) Preventive & Diagnostic Testing in Older Adults
- **Bone mineral density** scans are done **~2× more often** in **direct** clinics than in **franchise** clinics.  
- **FOBT (fecal occult blood)** screening and **follow‑up colonoscopy after positive FOBT** are **performed more often in franchise clinics**.  
- Chain‑of‑care analysis suggests an **imbalance** driven by **national quality‑indicator incentives**: tests included in the **National Primary‑Care Quality Measures** (e.g., FOBT) show elevated performance in franchise sites, potentially **crowding out** non‑incentivized care (e.g., bone density) relative to direct clinics.

## Interpretation

- The **operation model** (direct vs. franchise) is associated with **clinically and economically meaningful differences** in primary care delivery in East Jerusalem.  
- **Hospital‑system impact:** Elevated ER referral rates from franchise clinics point to **avoidable cost and load** on hospitals.  
- **Early‑childhood equity:** Large gaps in **early diagnosis and therapy** for speech and motor delays risk **long‑term developmental harm** and **widening disparities**.  
- **Quality‑indicator effects:** Incentivized measures appear to **shape clinical behavior** in franchise sites, underscoring the need for **balanced, context‑sensitive metrics**.

---

## Policy Recommendations

1. **Strengthen monitoring & quality assurance** tailored to franchise settings in East Jerusalem (process, outcome, and equity metrics).  
2. **Invest in transition to direct operation** where feasible, supported by the **Ministry of Health** and **Ministry for Jerusalem Affairs**.  
3. **Adopt population‑specific quality indicators** reflecting the needs of East‑Jerusalem patients (language, access, case‑mix).  
4. **Develop community‑care residency tracks** and **direct employment** pathways for physicians and therapists from East Jerusalem, with Arabic‑speaking, Israel‑licensed clinicians prioritized.  
5. **Ensure adequate referral pathways** to public or contracted providers, with transparent tracking from referral to completed treatment.

As an example of the type of analysis we do the map below shows the distance from any point in Jerusalem to the neasrest specialist Dr. (within the Clalit HMO) in various fields. Note the discrepancy between east and west Jerusalem.

The situation is even worse when comparing the population in west vs. east Jerusalem for various medical specialities.
