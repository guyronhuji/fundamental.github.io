# About Us

We are the Fundamental Interactions group at the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](http://www.huji.ac.il)'s [Racah Institute of Physics](http://phys.huji.ac.il). 

We are part of the nuclear and hadronic physics group but have close ties to the optics and non-linear groups operating at the institute.

## Our Research Focus

Among the questions we are currently trying to answer are:

- **Is there physics beyond the Standard Model?** How does one see the effects of such possible physics on low energy processes like nuclear beta decay?

- **How well do we know the structure of the proton and neutron?** Are the charge and magnetization distributions in them different from each other?

- **Is a muon just a heavy electron?** Or are there extra forces that effect muons and not electrons/

- **How can we use the anti-matter partner of the electron (the positron) to study material systems?**

- **What can we learn about epigenetic deregulation in cancer using single cell technologies?** 

## Our Facilities

We conduct experiments at world-class facilities including:

- [The Paul Scherrer Institute](http://www.psi.ch) - Swintzerland
- [Weizmann Institute](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/physics/nuc_exp/home.html) - Israel
- [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](http://weak0.physics.berkeley.edu/weakint/index.html) - California, USA
